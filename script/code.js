// 1. Variable
    // Variables are containers for storing information.
// 2. Value
    // JavaScript values are the values that comprise values like Booleans, Strings, arrays, numbers, etc.
// 3. Data type
    // Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables.
// 4. Initialization
    // When you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine.
// 5. Tell me the difference between let, var and const
    // Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared. If you never want a variable to change, const is the keyword to use.
// 6. What is a variable scope?
    // Variable Scope. Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.
// 7. When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop?
    // Use a for loop to iterate over an array.
    // Use a for loop when you know the loop should execute n times.
    // Use a while loop for reading a file into a variable.
    // Use a while loop when asking for user input.
    // Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.
// 8. Define hoisting and variable scoping
    // Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
